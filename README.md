# Building Websites With HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: Getting Started

## Tools

The following tools help make easier to work with sample code.

- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads): A tool for managing source code
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): A source code editor
- [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer): A simple web server utility for Visual Studio Code

## Setup

If you installed git you can clone the code to your machine, or download a ZIP of all the files directly.


```bash
git clone git@github.com:fortuneonyeka/my-pieshop.git
```

- Once the files are on your machine, open the my-pieshop folder in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

- With the files open in Visual Studio Code, press the **Go Live** button at the bottom of the window to launch the files with [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer).
